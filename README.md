# Problem statement
Inaccurate weather forecasts pose significant challenges to planning and decision-making processes across various sectors. Traditional forecasting methods often lack the precision needed to capture complex weather patterns effectively. These methods struggle to handle dynamic weather data and adequately model temporal dependencies. As such, there is a pressing need for a robust and accurate weather prediction system that can leverage advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. The objective is to develop a deep learning solution capable of providing precise weather forecasts, thereby enhancing preparedness and decision-making in sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.

#  Code description 
The problem is tackled with deep learning technique called RNN. RNNs are used in deep learning and in the development of models that simulate neuron activity in the human brain. They are especially powerful in use cases where context is critical to predicting an outcome, and are also distinct from other types of artificial neural networks because they use feedback loops to process a sequence of data that informs the final output. These feedback loops allow information to persist. This effect often is described as memory.
RNN use cases tend to be connected to language models in which knowing the next letter in a word or the next word in a sentence is predicated on the data that comes before it. A compelling experiment involves an RNN trained with the works of Shakespeare to produce Shakespeare-like prose successfully. Writing by RNNs is a form of computational creativity. This simulation of human creativity is made possible by the AI's understanding of grammar and semantics learned from its training set.
